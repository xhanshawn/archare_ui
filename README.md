# ArchareUI

Archare UI is a ui framework currently including a collapsable navigation sidebar and menu toggles for it. 
The newest version is 0.2.0.
[Archare](http://archare.elasticbeanstalk.com) is my personal site with some posts and simple data visualizations.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'archare_ui'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install archare_ui

## Usage

Archare UI uses some basic funcitonalities of Bootstrap. So please include it before using it. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
